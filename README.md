#  Teaching Algorithms and Growing STEM with Sphero
Students will be given an introduction to Sphero.
Students will then get to experiment with Sphero.edu and block coding.
Students will learn about algorithms through relatable examples and apply their knowledge to block coding. 
Students test their algorithmic knowledge by programming Sphero to move through a maze via block coding.
The Technology Ambassador Program (TAP) at GGC strives to break the misconceptions of the IT field by providing fun workshops for students of all backgrounds. TAP students design engaging and fun outreach workshops to encourage interest in IT and STEM.

# Project setup/Installation
## Sphero EDU Setup
First create a SpheroEDU teacher account. Click on my content then click on "Create a Program". Create your easy code that completes the easy part of the maze and do the same for the hard code. Once the program has been created, the proggram must be allocated into the shared resources, so the students will have access to it. To do this you go to your classes tab. Got to shared resources and click add programs. Select both codes and submit. When the students create a student account, they will see both codes under the resource tab. 
## Construction
In order to create the maze, a 36 in. x 46 in.
