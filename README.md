#  Teaching Algorithms and Growing STEM with Sphero
Students will be given an introduction to Sphero.
Students will then get to experiment with Sphero.edu and block coding.
Students will learn about algorithms through relatable examples and apply their knowledge to block coding. 
Students test their algorithmic knowledge by programming Sphero to move through a maze via block coding.
The Technology Ambassador Program (TAP) at GGC strives to break the misconceptions of the IT field by providing fun workshops for students of all backgrounds. TAP students design engaging and fun outreach workshops to encourage interest in IT and STEM.
