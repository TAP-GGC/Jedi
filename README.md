#  Teaching Algorithms and Growing STEM with Sphero
## Description
* Difficulty Level: Medium
* Target Audience: 6th Grade - College
* Duration of workshop: 60-90 minutes
* Needed Material: A classroom set of Spheros, Sphero EDU app,Sphero EDU website teacher account, a 36 in. x 48 in. foldable foam board, and a 36 in. x 48 in. plywood
* The primary goal of this project is educating others about algorithms by programming a robot through a maze using Sphero EDU. 
* Sphero is a small robot ball that moves around by either remote control or code you feed it. 
This workshop is geared towards educating and creating interest in the IT field for non STEM majors. 
By engaging in our workshops, students will get to experiment with Sphero.edu and block coding, which allows them to learn about algorithms through relatable examples. 
* The Technology Ambassador Program ([TAP](https://www.ggc.edu/academics/school-of-science-and-technology/research-internships-service-learning/technology-ambassador-program)) at GGC strives to break the misconceptions of the IT field by providing fun workshops for students of all backgrounds. TAP students design engaging and fun outreach workshops to encourage interest in IT and STEM.

## Project setup/Installation
### Installing Sphero EDU
1.	Open the Microsoft Store (or preferred app store)
2.	Click the Search bar.
3.	Type “Sphero Edu” in the search bar and press enter (without the “ “)
4.	Click on the app that says Sphero Edu.
5.	Click the “Get” or “Download” button that appears.
6.	Wait for the app to download completely and the app should open automatically.
•	If the app does not open automatically check to see if a short-cut was created on your desktop and double click it or search for “Sphero Edu” in the taskbar (search bar) of your computer.
•	If it still does not appear then the app might not have completely installed. You can check this by opening your downloads folder on your computer. 
7.	Once the app is opened a Welcome Message should appear. It will ask you to agree to the Terms of Use and Privacy Policy and Edu Privacy Policy. You must check both of these boxes in order to use the app.<br>
